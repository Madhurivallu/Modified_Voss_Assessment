 5. Describe how you might build in exception and error handling to your application.

1. Identify potential exceptions and errors: Identify potential points of failure in the application and the types of exceptions and errors that may occur.
2. Use try-catch blocks: Use try-catch blocks to enclose the code that may throw an exception. Inside the catch block, handle the exception by logging the error and providing a
   meaningful message to the user.
Use logging: Use a logging framework such as log4j or java.util.logging to log exceptions and errors. This allows you to keep track of when and where an exception occurred.
An example of using try-catch blocks in Java is:

Copy code
try {
   int result = 1 / 0;
} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
   System.out.println("Error: Cannot divide by zero");
}
