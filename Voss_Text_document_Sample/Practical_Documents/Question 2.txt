2.Briefly (a few sentences is fine) describe how you would set up a pipeline on your
preferred source control management platform to perform continuous integration
testing of a simple front end web-based application. It could be anything you like eg a
calculator that outputs the correct results from numbers you input.
 To set up a pipeline on Jenkins for continuous integration testing using Selenium WebDriver, Java, TestNG, and Maven, the following steps: can be taken:


1.Install the Jenkins plugin for Selenium and configure the necessary dependencies in the Jenkinsfile.

2.Set up a new Jenkins job and configure it to pull code from the GitHub repository containing the sample application.

3.In the build step, add a Maven goal to compile and test the code using the TestNG framework.

4.Configure post-build actions to archive the test results and send notifications on build status.

5.Set up the Jenkins job to trigger a build automatically on changes pushed to the GitHub repository, or set up a schedule for regular builds.

6.Set up a Selenium Grid to run tests on different browsers and platforms in parallel.

7.Set up the Jenkins job to integrate with Selenium Grid for running the tests

8.Configure the job to trigger the build only when a pull request is made, or when a new branch is pushed to the repository.

In summary, you would use Jenkins to pull code from a Github repository, use maven to build the code and test it using TestNG framework, 
integrate Selenium Grid and run the tests on different browsers, and trigger the builds automatically or on schedule.
